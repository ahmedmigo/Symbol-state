This plugin will make you save your overrides in any symbol in what I called "STATE", then you can re-use this overrides on any instance of this symbol
let's say we have button with nested symbols and you can change the background and the text by overrides. what if you saved each override with a name and then reuse them everywhere.
give me your thoughts and if it will be useful or not
